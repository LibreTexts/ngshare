Congrats, ngshare should be installed!
To get started, add the following to your JupyterHub helm chart's values:

hub:
  extraConfig:
    ngshare.py: |
      c.JupyterHub.services.append({
        'name': '{{ include "ngshare.name" . }}',
        'url': 'http://{{ include "ngshare.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.deployment.port }}',
        'api_token': '{{ include "ngshare.getToken" . }}'})

Afterwards, install ngshare_exchange in every Docker image that has nbgrader.
Then, place the following in /etc/jupyter/nbgrader_config.py:

from ngshare_exchange import configureExchange
c=get_config()
configureExchange(c, 'http://{{ include "ngshare.fullname" .}}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.deployment.port }}/services/{{ include "ngshare.name" . }}')
# Add the following line to let students access courses without configuration
# For more information, read Notes for Instructors in the documentation
c.CourseDirectory.course_id = '*'

Please let us know on Github if you encounter any issues, thanks!
{{- if .Values.ngshare.hub_api_token_is_random }}

WARNING: You didn't specify an API token, and one is generated automatically for you.
This will change every time you do a helm install or upgrade on ngshare,
so please consider specifying it explicitly in values.yaml under ngshare.hub_api_token
{{- end }}
{{- if gt .Values.deployment.replicaCount 1.0 }}

WARNING: You have specified more than one replica for ngshare.
This means the PVC for it will be mounted ReadWriteMany.
Make sure you have a storage provisioner that supports that.
We haven't tested whether sqlite will break when it's mounted multiple times,
so you are walking into uncharted territory here. Please reconsider.
{{- end }}
{{- if not .Values.ngshare.admins }}

WARNING: You have specified no admin users.
Only admins can create courses, so please add an admin user to the configuration.
{{- end }}
{{- if .Values.ngshare.debug }}

WARNING: DEBUG MODE IS NOW ON!!!!!!
DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION. This will leak API tokens to users and
allow people to dump the database, among other things. You have been warned.
